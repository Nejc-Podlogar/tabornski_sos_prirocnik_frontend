    "introApplication": "The application is primarily intended for scouts who want to learn the Morse and Semaphore alphabets and practice their knowledge of orientation. \nThe application contains a translator, dictionary, learning materials and exercises. \nIt also includes the possibility of learning topography. \nThe application is designed to be easy to use and allows learning in various ways.",
  "introMorseCode": "In the Morse code alphabet you have several different tools available. \nYou have a translator to and from Morse code. \nYou can transmit translated text via the flashlight on your phone. \nThere are also learning materials available, which you can also download to your device. \nYou can also train on customized exercises to improve your knowledge of morse code.",
  "introSemaphore": "In the Semaphore alphabet you have several different tools available. \nYou have a translator to and from Semaphore. \nThere are also learning materials available, which you can also download to your device. \nThere is also a separate list for all the characters and special symbols.",
    "introTopography": "In orientation you have a lot of learning and revision materials available. \nAlso available separately are topographic signs, where you can learn and revise them with the help of customized exercises. \nTopographic signs used in the exercises are valid for the DTK25 map.",
